### What is Cub3D
Cub3D was a project where we had to make a mini 3D game engine in C. We used raycasting to simulate a first-person view in a maze. The goal was to render walls, handle player movement, and add textures to make it look more realistic. It all starts from a basic 2D map, but gives the illusion of depth, kind of like Wolfenstein 3D

### What is MinilibX
MiniLibX is a small graphics library used to create windows, display images, and handle keyboard/mouse events on Linux and macOS. In Cub3D, it allows for managing 2D/3D graphics rendering and user interaction for the game engine. It's essential for displaying textures and handling player movements in real-time.
